TL;DR: Google has created a monopoly of programs that are taking control of our daily lives.

The Google corporation is critically acclaimed for making many applications that are used in our daily lives. These applications vary from giving people the ability to stream videos to organizing their email. This has given the Google corporation or Alphabet Inc. the ability to lock us into its trap.  



Some of Google's applications include gmail, youtube, google drive, google docs, and google maps.

business stand point: why do people want more open and accessible?   

negatives: locked in, dependent on applications, forcing you to buy their products,
