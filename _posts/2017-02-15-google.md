TL;DR: Google has created a monopoly of programs that are taking control of our daily lives.

The Google corporation is critically acclaimed for making many applications that are used in our daily lives. These applications vary from giving people the ability to stream videos to organizing their email. This has given the Google corporation or Alphabet Inc. the ability to lock us into its trap. They have boxed us in, which has made us more dependent on outside help and are making money off of it.

Google has made a ton of applications for the world to use. Some of the many applications Google has created include gmail, youtube, google drive, google docs, and google maps. Alphabet Inc. claimes that their programs are a benefit to society. I think that this is the complete opposite. Applications like Google Maps have made society dependent on technology to find their way to get places. I know this from hands on personal experience that even going to my friends house that I have been to some much can sometimes be a challenge to navigate there on my own.



 Youtube has made people more dependent on being able to search up their information instead being able to think for themselves.

business stand point: why do people want more open and accessible?   

negatives: locked in, dependent on applications, forcing you to buy their products, google tries to keep their hold on you so they can make money with ads.
