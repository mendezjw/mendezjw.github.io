Today in our modern day society we spend a lot of time on the internet. It connects us together and brings millions of information to our fingertips. Most of us can't go without looking at a phone or computer screen for even one day. The reason for this ranges from streaming online videos to online shopping, which all requires the use of the internet. Now with all these features at our disposal, people have looked for a way to share this information with each other. This is where social media comes into play.

The internet has connected everyone with the ability to share information through social media. Some of these networks include facebook, twitter, instagram, and snapchat. They have proven to be beneficial in allowing people to form groups and make accounts with their friends to share what's on each other's minds. People are even given the ability to share videos and give feedback on events in the world.
