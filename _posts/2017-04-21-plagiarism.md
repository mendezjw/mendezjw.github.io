TL;DR: The public education system has become the source of the current plagiarism dilemma.

Plagiarism has been a recurring problem in the public education system. Students are now turning to copying other peoples working as their own due to the high amount of stress to be successful. Students now have to deal with the pressures of sustaining a GPA and writing a paper that will standout in their college process. 



Plagiarism is a recurring problem in the public education system due to lack of individual attention that is not given to students.



Problem: The public education system doesn't educate students effectively.

Solution: 1) Students need individualized plan for school.
          2) Classes designed to teach students how to site effectively instead of punishing them for not knowing how.
          3) Use programs like turnitin.com to make sure there are no errors on citation or plagiarism on due to student or teacher errors.

NaySayers: 1) Some may argue that the standardized test system is good at evaluating everyone equally, but in reality everyone doesn't think the same.
           2) Some may argue that classes do teach students how to cite correctly, but in reality not all teachers teach the same way in the public school system.
           3) Some may argue that programs like turnitin.com are ineffective compared to actual teachers, but a teacher will never be able to search through every article online as fast as a computer can.
