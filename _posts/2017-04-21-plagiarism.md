TL;DR: The public education system has become the source of the current plagiarism dilemma.

Plagiarism has been a recurring problem in the public education system. Students are now turning to copying other people's work as their own due to the high amount of stress on them to do well. Students now have to deal with the pressures of sustaining a GPA and writing a paper that will help them standout in their college process. The reasoning for this is that most students aren’t getting the attention they need as learns, classes aren’t being taught correctly, and they don’t know how to make sure they don’t have citation error themselves.

With the way some schools systems are set up right now, many of the younger generation are being treated as just a number. They are taught only to take a test instead of learning skills that are necessary later in life. The way to prevent this is to give students an individualized plan that will help guide students down paths of their interests, which will make them more excited to learn. There are some however who may argue that the standardized test system is good at evaluating everyone equally, but in reality everyone learns and thinks differently. This demonstrates how the issues are created in the classroom.

There have been too many english classes I have been in where the teachers haven’t gone over a minute of citation but required that I would have do some form of research. For others, their experience might have been losing points or even failing an essay because of their them not being able to cite their paper correctly. The solution for this is that schools need classes that are designed to teach students how to cite effectively instead of punishing them for not knowing how. This will help students develop the skills to cite correctly and retain the points that would be lost without them. There are people who will argue against this saying that classes already do teach these skills but in reality not every teacher will go over course material the same way. Even if the teacher is still not able to help there are other ways to check on citation.

Sometimes students will have have teachers that are not good at helping them cite material. In order to check on citation on their own, students can use programs like turnitin.com to make sure there are no errors that the student or teacher have missed. This is a good program to give peace of mind to students were failing a paper can drastically affected their grade just because of poor citation. Some may argue that programs like turnitin.com are ineffective compared to actual teachers, but a teacher will never be able to search through every article online as fast as a computer can to double check if any sources have been plagiarized.

Plagiarism has been a large dilemma in the public school system. Students have to deal with inadequate evaluation methods, poorly designed class plans, and teachers that are not unable to give students proper feedback. In order to combat this serious changes need to be made to course curriculums or simple but effective tools like turnitin.com need to be utilized. In conclusion, in order to stop plagiarism in school systems we need to treat students, not as a number, but as the unique person they are.
