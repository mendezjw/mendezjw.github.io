subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me
---

I am a student attending Allegheny College. I am a Double Major in both Music and Computer Science. I am currently freshman at the college. I was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1998. My family lives in Old Bridge, New Jersey.

I attended Old Bridge High School where I graduated in 2016. While I was there I participated in numerous music ensembles such as the Symphonic Band, Wind Ensemble, and Marching Band. My primary instrument is the Euphonium, however I also know how to play the Cymbals, Bassdrum, and Trombone. I have auditioned and performed with the Central Jersey Music Educators Association (CJMEA) and I am currently contracted to march with the Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps.

My interest in computer science comes from my interest in video games. I have been playing videogames since I owed my own Playstation One and Gameboy. I learned to enjoy shooters like Call of Duty and Counter Strike. I have participated in numerous programs that involved creating and designing levels for games, but never coding the games themselves. Now that I am out of highschool I have been able to take courses to get closer to this goal. I am not sure what I want to do with both these Majors, however I have ideas and interests that I am pursuing.
